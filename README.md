Claude Code skill - converts CLAUDE.md rules into automated checks (eslint, phpstan, pint, CI, etc.), freeing up agent context.

Inspired by [Matthieu Napoli's tweet](https://x.com/matthieunapoli/status/2024507469394039057). We extended the original prompt into a proper Claude Code skill with tooling-first priorities.

## How it works

1. Reads all CLAUDE.md files and inventories existing tooling (linters, CI, git hooks, etc.)
2. Identifies rules that can be expressed as automated checks
3. Presents proposed changes for your approval
4. Implements the checks using your project's existing tools
5. Removes the automated rules from CLAUDE.md after checks pass

Rules that require human judgment are kept as-is.

## Install

The repo doubles as a plugin marketplace (required by Claude Code for `plugin install` to work). `marketplace.json` points to the plugin in this same repo.

### Via skills.sh

```bash
npx skills add publicala/bake-claude-md-files
```

### Via Plugin Marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add publicala/bake-claude-md-files
/plugin install bake-claude-md-files@publicala
```

### Manual

Copy `skills/bake/SKILL.md` into your skills directory:

```bash
# Global (all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/bake-claude-md-files
cp skills/bake/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/bake-claude-md-files/

# Project-level
mkdir -p .claude/skills/bake-claude-md-files
cp skills/bake/SKILL.md .claude/skills/bake-claude-md-files/
```

## Usage

Both installation methods invoke the same skill:

- **skills.sh / manual**: `/bake-claude-md-files`
- **Plugin marketplace**: `/bake-claude-md-files:bake`
